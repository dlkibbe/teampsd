**1. You have logged in to mtl.how/sim and want to pull up a prior experiment. You should…:**  

a.	Go to the Experiments section, click on the red down arrow next to “Select Experiment”, select a prior experiment and click the red "Go" button.  

b.	Go to the Output section, navigate to the Control Panel containing Select Experiment, select the down arrow below Alternative 1, click on the experiment name you would like to pull up.  

c.	Only a is correct.  

d.	Both a and b are correct.  


**2. The main model tile of an mtl.how/sim module contains a red slider with the text “Return Visit Interval.” What does this red slider variable represent?**  

a.	The median return-to-clinic visit interval in weeks for patient visits with this team.  

b.	The proportion of patients who receive visits for each service provided by this team.  

c.	The weekly hours available within this team for intake visits.  

d.	The number of patients returning to start a new service with this team each week.  


**3. The main model tile of an mtl.how/sim module contains a green slider with the words “Referral Rate.” What does this green slider variable represent?**  

a.	The number of new patient referrals each week.  

b.	The number of clinic appointments available each week.  

c.	The number of appointment slots available for referrals.  

d.	The number of clinicians that are referring patients.  


**4. *Modeling to Learn* main model tiles contain 3 colors of sliders: red, green and purple. These sliders represent:**  

a.	Red=experiment from team data, Green=experiment from zero, Purple=sensitivity, change team feedback loops

b.	Red=experiment from patient data, Green=clinician-determined experiments, Purple=VISN rules that influence clinic measures

c.	Red=data from SAIL quality measures, Green=sensitivity to external influences on clinic operations, Purple=patient outcomes data

d.	Red= VISN rules that influence clinic measures, Green=patient-level health outcomes data, Purple=clinic team data


**5. All of the following terms are likely to be used when describing a systems story in *Modeling to Learn* except:**  

a.	Patient Coding  

b.	Feedback  

c.	Behavior  

d.	Time  


**6.  In a *Modeling to Learn* main model tile, the “Starting Rate” gauge has a blue line with an arrow leading to “Booking Rate.” The blue line has a plus sign (+) beside the arrow. What does this mean?**  

a.	There is a positive relationship between starting and booking rate; when you increase the starting rate, the booking rate increases.

b.	There is an inverse relationship between the starting and booking rate, when you increase the starting rate, the booking rate decreases.

c.	There is no relationship between Starting Rate and Booking Rate, this is just to show the path.

d.	Only b is correct.


**7. In an *MTL* experiment, your clinic team decided to lengthen the time between patient visits from eight to ten weeks. What variable will you change in the Experiments section to test the impact of this team decision?**  

a. Return to Visit Interval

b. Median Engagement Time

c. Missed Appointments

d. Referral Rate  


**8. Your team decided to shift all of its appointments for Adjunctive services to Psych and EBPsych services. What description below best represents what the chart images for Psych - Completing Rate and EBPsych - Completing Rate will look like in the Outputs section, Results Dashboard?**  

a. Appointments per week for Psych - Completing Rate and EBPsych - Completing Rate will rise over the two year experimental timeframe.

b. Appointments per week for Psych - Completing Rate will rise and EBPsych - Completing Rate appointments will decrease over the two year experimental timeframe.

c. Appointments per week for Psych - Completing Rate and EBPsych - Completing Rate will decrease over the two year experimental timeframe.

d. Appointments per week for Psych - Completing Rate and EBPsych - Completing Rate will not change over the two year experimental timeframe.  


**9. In an *MTL* model, the Return Visit Interval (RVI) is linked with a “negative sign” to Booking Rate and Work Pressure. Your team decides to increase their current RVI from 10 weeks to 12 weeks. What do you think will happen to Work Pressure in this experiment?**  

a. If the RVI is increased to 12 weeks, work pressure may decrease.

b. If the RVI is increased to 12 weeks, work pressure will increase.

c. If the RVI is increased to 12 weeks, there will be no impact on work pressure.

d. If the RVI is increased to 12 weeks, work pressure will stay the same.  


**10. A clinic team experimented with increasing the Return Visit Interval (RVI) for Psych services and shifting service proportions to decrease Adjunctive services and increase the proportion of appointments for Psych and EBPsych services. Over the two-year experiment window, which text below is the best description of one decision the clinic team might enter in the “Our Decisions” text box?**  

a. The team will implement an increase of one week in RVI for Psych services to test the impact. We expect to experience a short-term spike or oscillation in RVI – but the return to clinic visit interval will slowly reduce over two years to less than our original base case.

b. Increasing RVI was not realistic for any of the team’s services so we decided not to change RVI or service proportions.

c. Taking Adjunctive services to zero appointments will allow us to change our clinic team’s service offerings but only in the short-term.

d. Over two years, the team will test several changes to adjunctive services, Psych services, EBPsych services and examine the impact on work pressure.
