## Active listening is a stance. 
Taking the stance that misunderstanding is the norm and using skills appropriate to that reality.

### 1. General skills: Reflecting content for efficiency and interpersonal rapport (i.e., avoiding rework and frustration)
- "When in doubt, check it out" - It's the listener's job to help the speaker understand what they are getting or what they missed.
- Let the speaker know when you're falling behind. Stop them before the conversation exceeds your understanding.
- Use the same precise language/vocabulary, esp. Team PSD or _MTL_ terms with specific meanings.

### 2. "Chunking" components of what someone said (e.g., listen for the "and" when someone is speaking)
- Listen for the main points.
- This is a key skill to keep up with complex ideas in the moment (You don't want to get bogged down on point 1 and miss point 2).

### 3. Reflection of feeling - listen for the feeling words and reflect them exactly. 
- Using the exact feeling word you heard is the safest way to ensure the person feels heard. 
- Don't reflect "frustration" when someone is expressing "disappointment" or "stress."
- You can use these for non-verbals too.
- If you hear a feeling, it's best to address it in your reflection.

### 4. Synthesize two person's ideas - or just two ideas (or more)
- e.g. "on the one hand, I hear Anthony saying..." and "on the other hand, I hear Stacey saying..."
- Synthesis brings the ideas together. It is not just active listening both ideas as separate ideas.

### 5. Summarize - used when it's time to wrap up, and move on, and a lot of ideas have been said.
- This is not the time to bring up new points. If you do have something to add, say it first.
- It's best to end with a summary of the key points of consensus and the key take aways of what to do next.

### 6. After you reflect, add to what the person is saying (a key to improv is "yes, and..." - don't reject ideas, just try to understand first and then build on the ideas).
- Forward momentum comes from making sure you understand the person and add your own contribution.
- Listening is about being present to understand; you do not have to agree with what a person is saying.
- Before you even get to agreement/disagreement, make sure you have a shared understanding first.
- KEY IDEA: Really attend to make sure you understand. Do NOT think about your response when you should be listening.

### Things to look out for when listening -
#### Know thyself:
You are the only one who knows whether it's time to multi-task, focus, scribe/document as a form of listening, or whether typing would be a distraction.
#### Repetition cycle: 
If the speaker you're listening to keeps repeating something, your first move should be to assume that you're missing something and ask what it is.
#### Your own feelings:
If you're starting to feel frustrated, it's a key sign that you should use active listening to get back on the same page.
