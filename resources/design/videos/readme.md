# Team PSD 2.0 Participatory Learning and Design _at Scale_

### Instructions
Make **user-persona videos** testing Team PSD prototypes (aka MVPs: 'minimum viable products').

### Principles for Participatory Design Artifacts
1. **Scale** 
     - **We want to develop and test prototypes iteratively and asynchronously.** 
     - **We are using the GitHub platform to continuously integrate distributed Team PSD contributions.**
     - This means:
          - **Users** test, produce artifacts, and add them to the Team PSD library to be used by multiple prototype developers.
          - **Prototype** developers review artifacts iteratively (by user) and asynchronously (on their own without the user).
          - All our Team PSD prototype user test artifacts include user **learning ('upskilling').**
2. **Learning**
     - **Team PSD processes include participatory learning.** 
          - **Prototyping** includes individual learning from existing online trainings.
     - We are **upskilling** to improve scale across our nationally distributed team and array of partners.
          - **Continuous integration** of Team PSD universal standard languages.
     
### Methods for these Design Artifacts
- We adapted **cognitive think-aloud protocols _to scale_.**
     - We assess **usability** and **user experience.**
     - We enlist **mixed-methods** (qual + quan).
     - These are the instructions for **passive screen video observation of usability.**

### Context - _Why_ this is critical for Team PSD 2.0 to scale?
- To scale Team PSD processes, we evaluate the **usability** and **user experience** of Team PSD prototypes.
     - **Passive Screen Video Observation** 
          - Usability (quantitative MVP tests)
          - This test is the **concurrent** think aloud protocol to detect problems with MVP assumptions.
          - Prototype developers gain re-susable insights into the users (through the library).
          - Users don't have to think about producing these scalable artifacts (just upload).
          - These files are named with this convention "date_skill_training_user" e.g., "2020_05_13_git_ch1_busy_pi"
     - **Verbalization**
          - User-experience (qualitative MVP tests)
          - This test is the **retrospective** think aloud protocol to detect problems with MVP assumptions.
     - **Learning task performance.**
          - We need **distributed Team PSD users** to _learn at scale._
          - All prototypes are teaching our learners a skill they need to contribute to the team.
          - As we upskill, we continuously integrate prototypes, which scales learning _and_ improvement across Team PSD. 

## _How_ to create Screencast Videos - No Audio 

### PC

#### Record any window on your PC.
The Game DVR feature can capture any application’s window. 

1. **Press Windows + G** in any application on Windows 10. 
2. **Look for the Game Bar** that will appear. 
3. **Select “Yes, this is a game”** even if the application isn’t a game.

**Reminder:** _Protect your privacy_ and only include information that is relevant for Team PSD prototyping.

### Mac

#### Record any window on your Mac.

1. **Press Shift-Command-5**. The _Onscreen Controls_ will appear.
2. Once the _Onscreen Controls_ appear, click on one of the buttons with the record circle in the bottom right (4th icon from the left - **Record Entire Screen** or 5th icon from the left - **Record Selected Portion**)
3. **Click the down arrow** under _Options_, located next to the record button.
4. Under _Microphone_, **select none** to turn off audio recording.
5. Under _Options_ in the _Onscreen Controls,_ **adjust the recording window,** setup a _Timer_, and where to _Save To_ your recording.

6. In the _Menu Bar_, **click the Stop Recording button** or **press Command-Control-Esc (Escape)** to stop recording.

## Purpose: Our Team PSD 2.0 User and Prototype Design Libraries
1. **Participatory design** helps our team to scale Team PSD improvements.
2. **We identify:** a) how team users learn, b) how learning differs by skill, c) how trainings are used to learn, and d) how this changes over time.
3. **Prototyping is asynchronous and distributed:** 
     - Team PSD **users** learn and prototype when it is best for them.
     - Team PSD **MVP developers** review artifacts when it is best for them.
     - Team PSD prototypes are **iteratively integrated** during design and user testing.
     - Design artifacts are **machine and human readable** for use across the team now and in the future.
