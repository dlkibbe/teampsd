# Team PSD 2.0 

User-centered participatory learning and design of **Team PSD 2.0**.
- **Team PSD 2.0** is more scalable due to continuous integration, deployment and documention.
- We aim for a completely free, accessible, transparent and reproducible workflow (aka **"open science"**).
- **Our mission** to improve how healthcare quality improvement decisions are made enlists diverse team members and partners.
- We want to **empower** effective contributions from all potential stakeholders.

## Synthesizing Participatory Learning and Participatory Design 

- **Team PSD** already developed [_Modeling to Learn_](https://mtl.how/) to scale nationally in the Veterans Health Administration.
  - The **participatory learning** principles we scaled in _Modeling to Learn_ are:
    - equitable access to resources
    - mutual learning
    - shared decision-making

## Schedule: Team PSD is using our **may_epic** to reboot Team PSD.
- **Week 1:** HQ, quant and Sim UI/Model workgroups develope user personas.
- **Week 2:** HQ, quant and Sim UI/Model develop hypotheses for testing prototypes (or fast and cheap minimum viable products) for these user personas. 
  - During week 2, we will use prototyping with personas to identify the upgraded/integrated/automated workflows that follow the _pareto principle_.
  - To maximize the value of what we learn to build, we are identifying CI/CD fixes at a root level (20%) that will solve our 80% of our users' workflow painpoints.

- **Week 3:** HQ (#1192 **Team PSD Manual**) and Quant (**R21 Wrap-up**) set up their 20% Team PSD 2.0 workflow independently.
- **Week 4:** Finish user persona/testing work.
  - In June, we launch our **pilot of Team PSD 2.0** with _more_ Team PSD workgroups.

## Persona and Prototyping 

- **User-centered hypotheses test assumptions** that include user _training needs._
- **User points of view (POV)** of our **'limited Team PSD scale' problem** means that _upskilling_ user training costs must be tested.

### Team PSD how to resources:

1. How to make a **user-centered videos** (Team PSD-specific) videos of your prototypes ('minimum viable products').
