## Full Instructions
**1. How to Create Labels**  
Click [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-a-label) for instructions.

a. When creating new labels, follow the TeamPSD naming convention of "all lowercase, underscores in lieu of spaces". This will make it both human-readable, meaning it can naturally be read by humans, and machine-readable, meaning it is in a format that can easily be processed in code.
For example, "new_label" is correct, but "New_Label" or "newlabel" would not be correct.

b. The description of the label should be clear and outline a specific person or workgroup doing a specific task associated to that label.

c. Assign a color to the label based on the colors already used by other labels. Do not repeat a color.

**2. How to Edit Existing Labels**  
Click [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/editing-a-label) for instructions.

**3. How to Delete Labels**  
Click [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/deleting-a-label) for instructions.

**4. Purpose of Labels**  
Labels are used for two purposes in TeamPSD:
1. Dependency check: select all labels that correspond that have a potential dependency with the issue  
For example, an issue changing the name of a variable in the simulation user-interface may have a dependency with the learner SEE guides, facilitator SAY guides, and cheatsheets where the variable name may also need to be updated.
You would attach the label "document" to indicate that documents may need to updated once this change is made.  

2. Indicator of Responsible Workgroup: indicate the workgroup responsible for working on the issue
For example, if there is an issue for changing the name of a varialbe in the simulation user-interface, James/sim_ui workgroup would be responsible for making that change and we would attach the "sim_ui" label to the Issue card or Pull Request.

## Training Record:
#### Practice
###
- [ ] Exercise 1: Create a new label called "training" including a name, color, and description. What are the implications that may need to be considered for a "training" label? 
Make sure to include a clear action for a specific person or workgroup in the description related to training. Write down the label name, color, and description here:

- [ ] Exercise 2: Edit the label you created in Exercise 1 by 1) changing the color and 2) updating the description. Provide the updated information below. After review, delete the label.
