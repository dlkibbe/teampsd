# Session 05 MTL Facilitator Say Checklist  

# Today we're modeling to learn how to log in to our team world.  

### Navigate to the SEE guide to show Done/Do table

- [ ] [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/done.png" height = "40" width = "40">](#DontClick) Done: We checked to make sure we could log in to the sim UI at mtl.how/sim.    
- [ ] [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/do.png" height = "40" width = "40">](#DontClick) Do: We will upload our team data to the sim UI and review our data in the Experiments section.

## Learning Objectives for Session 5 - After this session you will be able to:  

1. Describe the team data in the Experiments section.  
2. Test out the simulation user interface for more information about team data.  
3. Apply clinical expertise to consider the decisions the team makes that affect these data variables.  

## Start Participatory Learning from Simulation (30 minutes)  
[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:10-00:20 – Review participatory learning from simulation concepts**

- [ ] In sessions 2 and 3, we reviewed use of data UI to examine team trends over the past two years *WHAT IS*  
 -- [ ]Cite example of what team noted in team data: *For example, we saw that...*  
- [ ] Focus of today is use of simulation user interface or SIM UI is to explore *WHAT IF*
 -- [ ] We will ask *WHAT IF* questions about different decisions the team could make, hypothesize about the results, and examine findings to inform future decisions.  
 
## Start In-session Exercise (30 minutes)  
[<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style = “display:inline-block”/>](#DontClick) ____________ **Time 00:15-00:25 – Confirm team lead for the day and upload data file to SIM UI**  

### 1. In session 3, we used our team data UI and clicked "Create Team Data Table" to produce our team data for simulation.  
- [ ] Identify team lead  

### 2. Let's now go back to mtl.how/data in an Internet Explorer window to check the name of our team_data_table file  
- [ ] Guide team lead to mtl.how/data and then to the team_data_table file  

### 3. The team data file for simulation is in our team folder, in the team_data_table folder.  
- [ ] Navigate to the team_data_table folder and click the "dot-dot-dot" so you can copy the filename of your team_data_table  

### 4. Guide team lead to log in to the sim UI. 
- [ ] Open a new browser window in Google Chrome and go to mtl.how/sim  
- [ ] Enter log in credentials: user name is VA email and password was provided to the team in an email pre-Session 5  
- [ ] Click the down-arrow in the *Please select a World* pop-up. Two options:"team" and "ind" for "individual". Since we're working together now as a team, choose the team world. If you are exploring the sim UI on your own, it's best to select your individual world.   
- [ ] Note the SIM UI application has a responsive web design, so it adjusts the page layout to optimize to your screen's dimensions  
- [ ] If there is a critical issue that everyone needs to be alerted to, there will be a red "Alert" pop-up upon login.  

### 5. Orient yourself to the home page (Team name, navigation icons, player name, welcome text, sections with blue headers).  

- [ ] From top left *MTL* logo - acts as a Home button - to right, six navigation icons: Home, Play, Team, More Info, News, Report Bug, Tutor and Logoff. Click on each to help team understand purpose for each.  
  - [ ] Highlight importance of logging off  
 
- [ ] Enter log in credentials: user name is VA email and password was provided to the team in an email pre-Session 5  
- [ ] Click the down-arrow in the *Please select a World* pop-up. Two options:"team" and "ind" for "individual". Since we're working together now as a team, choose the team world. If you are exploring the sim UI on your own, it's best to select your individual world.   
- [ ] Note the SIM UI application has a responsive web design, so it adjusts the page layout to optimize to your screen's dimensions  
- [ ] If there is a critical issue that everyone needs to be alerted to, there will be a red "Alert" pop-up upon login.  

- [ ] Click on the "Community" button on the bottom right if you have an idea, like something, or have a question.  
  - [ ] Community of Practice (CoP) contains FAQs and if you set up a GitHub account, you can ask your questions directly in the CoP or email *MTL* at mtl.help@va.gov  
  - [ ] **Never include any PII/PHI in descriptions and screenshots unless you are emailing mtl.help@va.gov. The Community of Practice is a public platform.  
   
- [ ] Review *MTL* welcome text below first row. Review 3 section headings in blue bars: Session, Experiment Maintenance, and Team Data Dropdown Maintenance.  
  - [ ] Whenever you see blue bars like these with a white triangle on the right, that means those sections can be expanded and collapsed by clicking on the bar.  
  - [ ] If you're not designated as a Team Lead, you won't see all of these features. But everyone is the “Team Lead” for their individual world, so will see all of these sections when you're logged in there.  
  - [ ] Review Experiment Maintenance section - delete, rename, or export experiments.  

### 6. Start a New Session [ [<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "15" width = "15">](#DontClick)__ ]  

+ Start a New Session and review the sim UI Main Page.   
   
+ Select the module your team decided to use.  
   
+ Select the team data you just uploaded.
